# SaeedGhani's Clone
This project is a simple clone of the Saeed Ghani website. The purpose of this project is to practice front-end development skills by replicating the design, layout, and functionality of the original website.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The website adjusts to different screen sizes and devices.
- **HTML & CSS:** Structured with HTML5 and styled with CSS3 to closely match the original.
- **JavaScript:** Basic interactivity to enhance user experience (e.g., sliders, form validation, etc.).
