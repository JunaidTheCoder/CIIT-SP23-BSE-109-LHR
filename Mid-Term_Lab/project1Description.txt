In this project, I cloned the **Saeed Ghani** website, which specializes in selling beauty products such as face washes, oils, and skincare items. The project involved replicating 
its layout, responsive design, and e-commerce functionalities. By focusing on key features like product displays, smooth navigation, 
and user interaction, I deepened my understanding of web development technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and learned how to implement dynamic content for a commercial website.
